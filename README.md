# AFLL PLY Mini-Project: Custom Tokenizer and Parser

## Overview

This project is a mini-project for the course **Automata, Finite Languages, and Logic (AFLL)**.

The core objective is to design and implement a custom **Tokenizer (Lexer)** and **Parser** for a specific language grammar. This implementation leverages **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)**, a powerful tool that mimics the functionality of the classic Unix tools `lex` and `yacc`.

## Features
* **Tokenization (Lexing):** Converts an input stream of characters into meaningful tokens (lexemes) based on defined regular expressions.
* **Parsing:** Constructs a parse tree (or executes actions) from the stream of tokens, ensuring the input conforms to the language's defined grammar.
* **Technology Stack:** Built entirely using Python and the `ply` library.
* **Custom Grammar:** Supports a grammar tailored for the AFLL course, which typically involves arithmetic expressions, logical statements, or a simplified programming language structure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** Version 3.x
* **pip:** Python package installer

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PerepaMoorty/afll_ply_miniproject.git](https://github.com/PerepaMoorty/afll_ply_miniproject.git)
    cd afll_ply_miniproject
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project primarily relies on the `ply` package. You can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install ply
    ```
    *(If there is a `requirements.txt` file in your repository, replace the above command with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)*

## Usage

The project likely contains a main script (e.g., `parser.py` or `main.py`) inside the `Mini-Project` directory.

To run the program and test your Lexer/Parser:

1.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Mini-Project
    ```

2.  Execute the main script, passing an input file or an expression string to be analyzed:
    * **To analyze an expression directly (Example):**
        ```bash
        python your_main_script_name.py "2 + 3 * (5 - 1)"
        ```
    * **To analyze content from a file (Example):**
        ```bash
        python your_main_script_name.py --file input.txt
        ```

*(**Note:** Replace `your_main_script_name.py` and the usage flags with the actual names and command-line arguments of your implementation.)*

### Expected Output:

The output will typically show:
1.  A list of tokens generated by the Lexer.
2.  A confirmation that the input was successfully parsed, or an error message indicating a syntax violation.

## Project Structure

The key files for the lexer and parser are expected to be located within the `Mini-Project` folder:
